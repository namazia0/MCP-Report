# MCP-Report

During the Winter Semester 2025/26, I am attending the Seminar of the MLAI Research Group at the University of Bonn.
My work in this seminar focuses on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with an emphasis on its security aspects.

This repository will contain my seminar report on the topic as well as related code and experiments involving MCPs.
